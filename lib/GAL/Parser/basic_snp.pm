=for author to fill in:
     Brief code example(s) here showing commonest usage(s).
     This section will be as far as many users bother reading
     so make it as educational and exemplary as possible.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2

     Title   : new
     Usage   : GAL::Parser::basic_snp->new();
     Function: Creates a GAL::Parser::basic_snp object;
     Returns : A GAL::Parser::basic_snp object
     Args    :

	my ($self, @args) = @_;

	$self->SUPER::_initialize_args(@args);

	my $args = $self->prepare_args(@args);

	my @valid_attributes = qw();

	$self->set_attributes($args, @valid_attributes);

	# Set the column headers from your incoming data file here
	# These will become the keys in your $record hash reference below.
	$self->fields([qw(chromosome location variant)]);
}

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=head2 parse_record

 Title   : parse_record
 Usage   : $a = $self->parse_record();
 Function: Parse the data from a record.
 Returns : A hash ref needed by Feature.pm to create a Feature object
 Args    : A hash ref of fields that this sub can understand (In this case GFF3).

=cut

sub parse_record {
	my ($self, $record) = @_;

	# $record is a hash reference that contains the keys assigned
	# in the $self->fields call in _initialize_args above

	# Fill in the first 8 columns for GFF3
	# See http://www.sequenceontology.org/resources/gff3.html for details.
	my $id         = join ':', ('CH', $record->{chromosome}, $record->{location});
	my $seqid      = $record->{chromosome};
	my $source     = 'Chad_Huff';
	my $type       = 'SNP';
	my $start      = $record->{location};
	my $end        = $record->{location};
	my $score      = '.';
	my $strand     = '+';
	my $phase      = '.';

	# Create the attributes hash

	# Assign the reference and variant allele sequences:
	# reference_allele=A
	# variant_allele=G
	my $variant_allele = $record->{variant};

	# Assign the reference and variant allele read counts:
	# reference_reads=A:7
	# variant_reads=G:8

	# Assign the total number of reads covering this position:
	# total_reads=16

	# Assign the genotype:
	# genotype=homozygous

	# Assign the probability that the genotype call is correct:
	# genotype_probability=0.667

	#my ($genotype, $variant_type) = $record->{variant_type} =~ /(.*?)_(.*)/;

	# Any quality score given for this variant should be assigned
	# to $score above (column 6 in GFF3).  Here you can assign a
	# name for the type of score or algorithm used to calculate
	# the sscore (e.g. phred_like, clcbio, illumina).
	# my $score_type = 'template';

	# Create the attribute hash reference.  Note that all values
	# are array references - even those that could only ever have
	# one value.  This is for consistency in the interface to
	# Features.pm and it's subclasses.  Suggested keys include
	# (from the GFF3 spec), but are not limited to: ID, Name,
	# Alias, Parent, Target, Gap, Derives_from, Note, Dbxref and
	# Ontology_term. Note that attribute names are case
	# sensitive. "Parent" is not the same as "parent". All
	# attributes that begin with an uppercase letter are reserved
	# for later use. Attributes that begin with a lowercase letter
	# can be used freely by applications.

	# For sequence_alteration features the suggested keys include:
	# reference_allele, variant_allele, reference_reads, variant_reads
	# total_reads, genotype, genotype_probability and score type.

			  ID               => [$id],
