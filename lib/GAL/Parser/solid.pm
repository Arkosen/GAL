=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use GAL::Parser::solid;

=for author to fill in:
     Brief code example(s) here showing commonest usage(s).
     This section will be as far as many users bother reading
     so make it as educational and exemplary as possible.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for author to fill in:
     Write a full description of the module and its features here.
     Use subsections (=head2, =head3) as appropriate.

=head2 parse_record

 Title   : parse_record
 Usage   : $a = $self->parse_record();
 Function: Parse the data from a record.
 Returns : A hash ref needed by Feature.pm to create a Feature object
 Args    : A hash ref of fields that this sub can understand (In this case GFF3).

=cut

sub parse_record {
	my ($self, $record) = @_;

	# $record is a hash reference that contains the keys assigned
	# in the $self->fields call in _initialize_args above

	# Create the attribute hash reference.  Note that all values
	# are array references - even those that could only ever have
	# one value.  This is for consistency in the interface to
	# Features.pm and it's subclasses.  Suggested keys include
	# (from the GFF3 spec), but are not limited to: ID, Name,
	# Alias, Parent, Target, Gap, Derives_from, Note, Dbxref and
	# Ontology_term. Note that attribute names are case
	# sensitive. "Parent" is not the same as "parent". All
	# attributes that begin with an uppercase letter are reserved
	# for later use. Attributes that begin with a lowercase letter
	# can be used freely by applications.

	# genotype_probability=0.667;

	# Any quality score given for this variant should be assigned
	# to $score above (column 6 in GFF3).  Here you can assign a
	# name for the type of score or algorithm used to calculate
	# the sscore (e.g. phred_like, clcbio, illumina).
	# score_type=watson_snp;

	# total_reads, genotype, genotype_probability and score type.
