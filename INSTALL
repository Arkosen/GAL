Genome Annotation Library (GAL)

To install a basic functioning GAL you'll need a few Perl modules
installed via CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/).  An installation script has
been provided which will automatically install all the dependencies
for you.  There are some accessory scripts within the GAL package that
require additional dependencies, and the install script will ask you
if you want to install these.  You can answer either yes or no and
it won't affect the basic functionality of the GAL library.

1) GAL Quick Install:

   ---------------------------------------- COMMAND LINE ----------------------------------------

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
Have a look at the examples in GAL/bin/examples and look at the documentation in GAL/docs/html.
