<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>The Genome Annotation Library is a collection of modules that strive
to make working with genome annotations simple, intuitive and fast.
Users of GAL first create an annotation object which in turn will
contain Parser, Storage and Schema objects.  The parser allows
features to be loaded into GAL's storage from a variety of formats.
The storage object specifies how the features should be stored, and
the schema object provides flexible query and iteration functions over
the features.  In addtion, Index objects (not yet implimented) provide
additional key/value mapped look up tables, and List objects provide
aggregation and analysis functionality for lists of feature
attributes.

</P>
<P>A wide variety of parsers are available to convert sequence features
from various formats, and new parsers are easy to write.  See
GAL::Parser for more details.  Currently MySQL and SQLite storage
options are available (a fast RAM storage engine is on the TODO list).
Schema objects are provided by DBIx::Class and a familiarity with that
package is necessary to understanding how to query and iterate over
feature objects.

</P><H1><A NAME="CONSTRUCTOR">CONSTRUCTOR

</A></H1>

<P>New Annotation objects are created by the class method new.  Arguments
should be passed to the constructor as a list (or reference) of key
value pairs.  All attributes of the Annotation object can be set in
the call to new, but reasonable defaults will be used where ever
possilbe to keep object creation simple.  An simple example of object
creation would look like this:

</P>
<PRE>    my $feat_store = GAL::Annotation-&gt;new();</PRE>

<P>The resulting object would use a GFF3 parser and SQLite storage by
default and it would not have access to feature sequence.

</P>
<P>A more complex object creation might look like this:

</P>
<PRE>    my $feat_store = GAL::Annotation-&gt;new(parser  =&gt; {class =&gt; gff3},
					  storage =&gt; {class =&gt; mysql,
						      dsn   =&gt; 'dbi:mysql:database'
						      user  =&gt; 'me',
						      password =&gt; 'secret'
					  fasta   =&gt;  '/path/to/fasta/files/'
					  );</PRE>

<P>The constructor recognizes the following parameters which will set the
appropriate attributes:

</P><DL><DT><A NAME="*%20parser%20%3d%3e%20parser_subclass%20%5bgff3%5d">* <CODE>parser =&gt; parser_subclass [gff3]</CODE>

</A></DT>
<DD>
This optional parameter defines which parser subclass to instantiate.
This parameter will default to gff3 if not provided.  See GAL::Parser
for a complete list of available parser classes.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="*%20storage%20%3d%3e%20storage_subclass%20%5bSQLite%5d">* <CODE>storage =&gt; storage_subclass [SQLite]</CODE>

</A></DT>
<DD>
This optional parameter defines which storage subclass to instantiate.
Currently available storage classes are SQLite (the default) and
mysql.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="*%20fasta%20%3d%3e%20'%2fpath%2fto%2ffasta%2ffiles%2f">* <CODE>fasta =&gt; '/path/to/fasta/files/</CODE>

</A></DT>
<DD>

<P>This optional parameter defines a path to a collection of fasta files
that correspond the annotated features.  The IDs (first contiguous
non-whitespace charachters) of the fasta headers must correspond to
the sequence IDs (seqids) in the annotated features.  The fasta
parameter is optional, but if the fasta attribute is not set then the
features will not have access to their sequence.  Access to the
sequence in provided by Bio::DB::Fasta.

<P>GAL::Parser - Parser objects for the Genome Annotation Library

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>&lt;GAL::Parser&gt; is not intended to be instantiated by itself, but rather
functions as a base class for &lt;GAL::Parser&gt; subclasses.  It provides a
variety of attributes and methods that are generally applicable to all
parsers.  While parsers are intended for use from within
&lt;GAL::Annotation&gt; objects. Parsers can be instantiated seperately from
the rest of the GAL library and there are many use cases for the
parsers as stand alone objects.  Anytime you just need fast access to
iterate over all features in a flat file and are happy to have hashes
of those features you should just use the parser directly without the
&lt;GAL::Annotation&gt; object.

</P><H1><A NAME="CONSTRUCTOR">CONSTRUCTOR

</A></H1>

<P>New GAL::Parser::subclass objects are created by the class method
new.  Arguments should be passed to the constructor as a list (or
reference) of key value pairs.  All attributes of the Parser object
can be set in the call to new. An simple example
of object creation would look like this:

</P>
<PRE>    my $parser = GAL::Parser::gff3-&gt;new(file =&gt; 'data/feature.gff3');</PRE>

<P>The constructor recognizes the following parameters which will set the
appropriate attributes:

</P><DL><DT><A NAME="*%20file%20%3d%3e%20feature_file.txt">* <CODE>file =&gt; feature_file.txt</CODE>

</A></DT>
<DD>
This optional parameter provides the filename for the file containing
the data to be parsed. While this parameter is optional either it, or
the following fh parameter must be set.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="*%20fh%20%3d%3e%20feature_file.txt">* <CODE>fh =&gt; feature_file.txt</CODE>

</A></DT>

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>&lt;GAL::Schema&gt; provides access to all of the query and iteration goodness of
the excellent DBIx::Class package.  To understand how to tap into all of this
you will want to be familiar with &lt;DBI&gt;, &lt;DBIx::Class&gt;, and to a lesser extent
&lt;SQL::Abstract&gt;.  All of those projects are well documented on CPAN.

</P>
<P>This particular module doesn't really do much execpt provide a base class
the modules below it, and load them up.  One additional function provided here
is to load GAL::SchemaAnnotation which provides a single method 'annotation'
so that each feature constructed by DBIx::Class can have access to a weakened
copy of the GAL::Annotation object that is managing it.

<PRE>    use GAL::Reader::DelimitedLine;
    $reader = GAL::Reader::DelimitedLine-&gt;new();
    $reader-&gt;file('annotation_file.gff');

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>

<P>&lt;GAL::Reader::DelimitedLine&gt; provides delimited file (tab delimited, csv etc.)
reading capability to GAL.  It is not intended for general library use, but
rather as a GAL::Reader subclass for developers of GAL::Parser subclasses.
There is however no reason why it couldn't also be used as a stand alone
module for other purposes.

</P><H1><A NAME="CONSTRUCTOR">CONSTRUCTOR

</A></H1>

<P>New GAL::Reader::DelimitedLine objects are created by the class method new.
Arguments should be passed to the constructor as a list (or reference)
of key value pairs.  All attributes of the Reader object can be set in
the call to new. An simple example of object creation would look like
this:

</P>
<PRE>  $reader = GAL::Reader::DelimitedLine-&gt;new(field_names =&gt; \@field_names);</PRE>

<P>The constructor recognizes the following parameters which will set the
appropriate attributes:

</P><DL><DT><A NAME="*%20field_names%20%3d%3e%20%5bqw(seqid%20source%20type%20start%20end)%5d">* <CODE>field_names =&gt; [qw(seqid source type start end)]</CODE>

</A></DT>
<DD>

<P>This optional attribute provides an orderd list that describes the
field names of the columns in the delimited file.  If this attribute
is set then a call to next_record will return a hash (or reference)
with the given field names as keys, otherwise next_record will
return an array of column values.

</P>
<P>The following attributes are inhereted from GAL::Reader:

</P></DD>
<DT><A NAME="*%20file%20%3d%3e%20feature_file.txt">* <CODE>file =&gt; feature_file.txt</CODE>

</A></DT>
<DD>
This optional parameter defines what file to parse. While this
parameter is optional either it, or the following fh parameter must be
set before the first call to next_record.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="*%20fh%20%3d%3e%20%24FH">* <CODE>fh =&gt; $FH</CODE>

</A></DT>
<DD>
This optional parameter provides a file handle to parse. While this
parameter is optional, either it or the previous must be set before
the first call to next_record.

</DD>
</DL>
<H2><A NAME="field_names">field_names

</A></H2>

<PRE> Title   : field_names
 Usage   : $reader = $self-&gt;field_names([qw(seqid source type)]);
 Function: Set the names for the columns in the delimited text.  If this
	   attribute is set then next_record will return a hash (or reference)
	   otherwise it will return an array (or reference).
 Returns : The next record from the reader.

<PRE> Title   : next_record
 Usage   : $record = $reader-&gt;next_record();
 Function: Return the next record from the reader

system.  You don't instantiate objects from it or any of it's
subclasses yourself, &lt;DBIx::Class&gt; does that for you, hence there is
no constructor and there are no attributes available, but you will
want to have a look at the methods as they provide the base
functionality for all sequence feature subclasses.  to all subclasses
as well.  The first 8 methods provide access to the features primary
data as defined by the first 8 columns of GFF3
